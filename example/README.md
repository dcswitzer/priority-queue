# priority-queue example
We will use the [`priority-queue`][priority-queue] and implement [Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm][dijkstra].

> Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

## Problem
We will solve the problem as discussed on the [wikipedia page][dijkstra].
